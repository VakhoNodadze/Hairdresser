It's a simple Hardresser's application.

Functionalities:

1)You can register as a client or as a hairdresser

2)Each role has it's own specific fields

3)If you register as a hairdresser, you're specifications will be
added to the list of available hairdressers. You cannot login
as a hairdresser

4)If you register as a client, you can login and see all th
available hairdressers, including the ones you might have registered as

5)You can book them. After you book them, you can give them a review
consisting of a score 1-10 and a comment.


Using redux for registration, ordering and reviews.

Execuse me for the poor design, this project was done in 10-12 hours.
It just has bare bones to show the neccessary requirements. 
Adding some more styling is a matter of 2-3 hours.


To view the application, downlaod the project, run npm install or yarn install
